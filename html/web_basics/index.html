		<h2>
			You read the title correctly. We're talkin' bout waffles.
		</h2>
		<h3>
			That's right. I'm gonna make you read a bunch of nonsense about waffles.
		</h3>
		<p>
			Behold the magnificence of waffles. Believe it or not, waffles originated in the late 14th century, and one of the earliest known recipies for waffles involved putting wine into the waffle mix. Because the French knew how the live back then, and breakfast wine is a fantastic idea.

			Eventually the Belgians came up with waffle irons and made the terrible mistake of removing wine from the recipie. So now we just have wine on the side, and call the whole thing "brunch."

		<h3>
			But enough about the history of waffles in paragraph form. We need us some information about waffles in list form.
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Waffles are exetremely popular in Belgium. Presumably because the only foods Belgium are known for are chocolate, fries, beer, and waffles. And while chocolate fries and beer sounds amazing, it would probably kill you pretty quickly.</li>

			<li>You can put all kinds of crazy stuff on waffles, like chocolate, ice-cream, chocolate ice-cream, and chicken!</li>

			<li>No seriously, you can put chicken on waffles. Have you never tried it? Ok, next chance you get, come up to harlem and go to this place called "Amy Ruth's". Top notch chicken and waffles there. I think it's on the corner of Lenox Ave and W 116th street. I'll put a link to their website after this list. </li>

			<li><strong><em> This is not up for debate.</em></strong> Go and partake of the chicken and waffles.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>
			Let me give you an ordered list on why you should stop reading this and go get some waffles right now.
		</h3>
		<ol>
			<li> Delicious. Need I say more? </li>
			<li> They've got built-in square indents to better hold the maple syrup.</li>
			<li> Throw some powdered sugar and whipped cream on there, along with some strawberries, or blueberries, or bananas, or just more syrup because why let fruit get in between you and breakfast magic?</li>
			<li> <em> <strong> Have I mentioned how well they go with chicken yet? </strong> </em> </li>
