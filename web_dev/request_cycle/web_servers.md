1. Small is beautiful
Make each program do one thing well
Build a prototype as soon as possible
Choose portability over efficiency
Store data in flat text files
Use software leverage to your advantage
Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability
Avoid captive user interfaces
Make every program a filter

2. A virtual private server is a copy of an operating system that users can install almost any software on. They function in the same way that a dedicated physical server does, but tends to have lower performance since it is sharing the physical hardware with other virtual private servers. The advantage to VPNs is that they act in the same manner a physical server would, but are much less expensive to maintain. The drawback is that they do not perform as well as physical servers.

3. As the root user on a Linux system you essentially have unrestricted access to every facet of the system. If you were to come across some malicious software and run it as a root user, it would be able to run rampant through your system and write to everything, causing potentially catastrophic damage.
