# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a tool used to keep track fo changes made to a file, and preserve previous versions of the file. This is useful in case you need to go back to a version of the file from before a certain change was made, either to try a new direction, or to see how the file evolved over time and why the users changed it the way they did.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a kind of offshoot of the master branch, that contains a feature or aspect that is easier to create or modify seperately, and then merge with the master branch later. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is an edit or revision to a file. A good commit message will explain the nature of the edit, and a brief reason as to why the edit was made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when, for whatever reason, a branch is unable to be merged with the master branch. Usually this happens if two branches are being merged that shared a common base commit, but both branches changed that base commit in order to work. Since each of them are depending on their unique change to the base commit, they will not be able to merge.
